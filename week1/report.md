The deliverable is complete, except I was unable to get the expected results from the codon on data1.

I was unable to reproduce the results specified in the original repo by Zhongyu Chen because I didn't have enough information to calculate an NGA50.

The deliverable for this week can be run with ./evaluate.sh in the week1 directory.

I used ChatGPT and Claude for help with this assignment, see ai.md.
